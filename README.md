My solutions to these programming questions (https://blog.svpino.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour).

I wrote the code in a hurry within a time limit, so don't expect to see beautiful code and the code is probably not optimized at all. The code hasn't been fully tested, too. So, expect some bugs!
